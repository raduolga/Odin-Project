    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I came up with this maple cupcake recipe a couple of years ago. They taste great and are not too sweet!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons margarine</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins.</li>
            <li>Beat maple syrup and margarine together in a large bowl until well mixed and creamy. Mix in egg until combined</li>
            <li>Combine all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and ginger in a small bowl. 
                Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in batches, alternating with the milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. 
                Fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
